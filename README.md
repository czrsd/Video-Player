# Video Player

The Video Player is a small web application built with Node.js that lets you upload videos. Once uploaded, you can watch them with a few video controls. These are the video controls:

- Play: Start playing the video.
- Pause: Pause the video.
- Skip 10 seconds: Jump forward by 10 seconds
- 10 seconds back: go back 10 seconds of the video
- Fullscreen: Hide video controls and make the video big
- Loop: Keep the video on repeat
- Volume settings: Adjust the volume of the video

The video player also has a time slider that you can use to scroll through the video. For short videos, it probably looks a bit weird.

## Installation

1. Download the repo to your computer.
2. Make sure you have [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the "Video-Player" directory using the `cd` command.
4. Run the following command to start the server:

```bash
node index.js
```

Once the server is up and running, it will say "Server is running on http://localhost:3000". Open your web browser and open the link to access the video player.
